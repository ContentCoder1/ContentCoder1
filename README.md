- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in media content and learning how to code, only a new to this so il keep it short and sweet
- I will be learning everything associated with computer science but primarly aim to learn front end web development 
- with Python being the first language i plan to take on. 
- I also intend to learn excel and SQL as both of these will aid me in my current job which is an adminstrational based role. 
- and in my spare time is where I will begin my journey in content creation specifically games, but also photography as well as a little side hustle 
- plenty to do so drop me a message if you feel the need. will get back to you ASAP
